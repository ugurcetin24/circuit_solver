Numerical Methods Circuit Solver (Manual Input GUI)
This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) developed for the final project of the Numerical Methods in Engineering course. It demonstrates core numerical analysis topics by allowing users to define electrical circuits manually and solve them using numerical techniques.

ðŸ”§ Features
This GUI covers all 12 major topics required by the course:

Numerical Topic	Included	Description
1. Error Analysis	âœ…	Compares nodal vs series results
2. Equation Solving	âœ…	Newton-based root approximation
3. Interpolation	âœ…	Linear interpolation + plot
4. Differentiation	âœ…	Numerical gradient of sin(x)
5. Integration	âœ…	quad integration of exp(-xÂ²)
6. Solving Linear Systems	âœ…	Used in nodal analysis
7. LU Decomposition	âœ…	LU factor + solve
8. Optimization	âœ…	Scalar minimization
9. Solving ODEs	âœ…	dy/dt = -2y with odeint
10. Stability & Error Control	âœ…	Detects invalid devre topologies
11. Visualization	âœ…	Graphs via Matplotlib
12. Comparative Analysis	âœ…	Error analysis: nodal vs simple
